### Why we need Python for Cloud/DevOps/SRE?

For ***AUTOMATION***.

### Best Pratices for coding
    Research first. (It might be already solved.)
    Ask the intelligent system. (Do not use the output drectly without understanding of the output.)
    Do not repeat yourself. (Create funtions)
    Keep it simple.
    Always add comments.
    Push your scripts to repositories. 
### Best Practices as an engineer.
    Document everything.
    Automate everything if possible.
    
### Libraries:
    Basic
        os -> For working with Operating System
        sys -> System
        io -> Input, Output
