### Why we need Python for Cloud/DevOps/SRE?

For ***AUTOMATION***.

### Best Pratices for coding
    Research first. (It might be already solved.)
    Ask the intelligent system. (Do not use the output drectly without understanding the output.)
    Do not repeat yourself. (Create funtions)
    Keep it simple.
    Always add comments.
    Push your scripts to repositories. (You don't want to repeat yourself again.)
### Best Practices as an engineer.
    Document everything.
    Automate everything if possible.
    
### Libraries:
    Basic
        os -> For working with Operating System
        sys -> System
        io -> Input, Output

    Testing

    UI: Although not common, these can be used for User Interface
        Streamlit
        flask
    
    APIs: Useful for backend development
        requests
        [flask]
        django
        django framework
    
    Infrastucture as Code
    
    Notebook (I use this because it's easy to write Python and shell script.)
        jupyter notebook
    
    Database
        sqllite
    
    Data Processing (for Data Engineering but it's useful.)
        Pandas
        PySpark (Distributed System)
        Kafka (Real-Time Data Processing)
